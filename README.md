# FGR

This repo contains the codes of equilibrium and nonequilibrium Fermi's Golden Rule charge transfer rate constant and rate (E-FGR and NE-FGR) for spin-boson systems with Condon and non-Condon diabatic coupling. The linearized semiclassical (LSC) approach was applied in the derivation of the theory.
