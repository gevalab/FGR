# FGR

This repo contains the codes of equilibrium Fermi's Golden Rule charge transfer rate constants (E-FGR) and nonequilibrium Fermi's Golden Rule charge transfer rates (NE-FGR) for spin-boson systems with Condon and non-Condon diabatic couplings. The linearized semiclassical (LSC) approximation was applied in the derivation of the theory. It is worth-mentioning that a hierarchy of approximations from LSC to the classic Marcus theory is proposed and benchmarked. The new strategies allow one to calculate charge transfer rates and rate constants directly from molecular dynamics simulations and can be extended to large-scales complex light-harvesting systems. An application to an organic photovoltaic system can be found in Paper 5. 

These programs are based on the following papers:
